# Free User Forms

The screen monitors the form/items/invoices/document opened by a user for edit at one time. These document sometimes tends to be left opened in case of power loss or application crash which prevents the user to access the document again as it has not been checked out.

To clear out open forms, right click on open form and click **`Free Up Form`**

 This will give access to form again for edit.
