## Step 2

Check the top-level parent in order to select all the childrenâ€™s underneath. This will select all the children under the parent **A81735**.

Uncheck all the items underneath the parent **A81735** which says "CutListItem\*" and click the **BOM** button on top left corner.

**This will show the discrepancy between the CAD model and Genius existing BOM.**

This will show all the items removed. This is signified by the colored light brown box against each item.

Click the Edit button &gt; Choose Selection button dropdown &gt; Select **Check all items in Genius not in CAD** \(Because we want our model to be reflecting the BOM\).

This option will select all the items which are removed from the assembly.
